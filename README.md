# SqlReplicationIoHooks

This is an example of the replication of a Synergy applications ISAM data to
a SQL Server database, in "near real-time".  The replication is performed by
a Synergy "replicator" program.  As the main Synergy application creates,
amends and deletes records from the ISAM files, the IO routines which are used
to isteract with the ISAM files also record these "transactions" in a
transaction log file called DAT:action.ism.  The replication server then comes
along, reads the transactions, and makes the corresponding changes to the SQL
Server database.

There are several advantages to taking this kind of approach, some of the major
ones being:

- You don't need to totally re-design your Synergy applications to store the
  actual application data in SQL Server. To do this properly would be a very
  major re-write of any application.

- You don't put the overhead of writing the data to both ISAM and SQL Server
  into your actual user applications, the performance overhead of which can
  be very significant.

- You don't make your user applications directly dependent on the database
  being started.  If the database, or replication server are not started then
  the transactions will simply build up in the log file until such time as
  they are started.

There will, of course, be some work to do in the Synergy applications. This is
not a project that will happen overnight. In order to be successful with this
type of project, the major requirements are:

- Having a consistent and unique key available in each of the ISAM files that
  is to be replicated. Synergex currently recommends adding an A20 field to
  the end of each replicated record layout, and populating that field with a
  unique timestamp value (from %DATETIME) of the time that each record was
  created. This will require a file conversion of any ISAM file which is to
  be replicated.

- Having consistently named file-specific IO routines for each data file to
  be replicated. These routines are easy to create (you could even base them
  on the routines in this example) but what can take time is ensuring that
  all create, amend or delete operations to the file, anywhere in your
  applications, use these routines.

- Having consistently named table and function specific SQL database access
  routines.  Again, these routines are easy to create, and again can be based
  on the examples provided with this demonstration.

## Requirements

This example was originally created using Synergy/DE V9.1.3 on a Windows system,
and should work on any higher version.  In theory the software should also work
on UNIX and OpenVMS, although some environmental setup would be required.  The
database used during testing was Microsoft SQL Server 2005 and the code should
work with any later version of SQL Server.

## Development Environment

Use workbench and open the Workspace SQLReplicaitonIoHooks.vpw This workspace
contains three projects, as follows:

application.vpj Contains a UI Toolkit application that includes an employee
                maintenance function. The replicator program can be started,
                stopped and controlled via menu items in the application.

library.vpj     Contains subroutines and functions that are used both by the
                UI Toolkit application, and the replicator program. Note that
                the main code used to interact with ISAM files (EmployeeIO.dbl)
                and the relational database (EmployeeSqlIO.dbl) are in this
                library. These files (and others) were code-generated by using
                the CodeGen utility.

load.vpj        Contains a sample program that can be used to load initial
                values for the replication key field in the customer file. The
                program was code generated using the AddReplicationKey template.

replicator.vpj  Contains the replicator program.

## Setup

If you wish to actually configure and execute this demo you will need:

- Synergy/DE (V9.1.3 or higher) Professional Series Workbench on Windows

- A SQL Server 2005 database (or higher) and at least one Synergy/DE SQL
  connection license available.  If you wish to avoid editing the supplied
  example code then use a SQL Server database on the same computer that you
  intend to run the Synergy code on, and make sure that database is configured
  to accept Windows Authentication.  If you do not use a local database then
  you will need to edit replicator.dbl, change the value of the SQL Connection
  "connect string" that is defined by DB_CONSTR. Refer to the SQL Connection
  manual for information about configuring connect strings.

- Create a new SQL Server database and make sure that the account that you will
  be using to connect to the database server has access to the new database.
  If you wish to avoid editing the supplied example code then name the database
  "SynergyReplication". If you do not use this default database name then you
  will need to edit replicator.dbl and change the database name, again in the
  connect string defined by DB_CONSTR.

- Start Workbench and open the workspace called SQLReplicaitonIoHooks.vpw. Use
  the "Project > Open Workspace..." menu option to do this.  Make sure you can
  see the "Projects" window.  If it is not active then make it active, if it
  is not displayed then display it by selecting "View -> Toolbars" from the
  menu and checking the "Projects" option.

- Make sure that the "replicator.vpj" project is the current project (it
  should appear bold when compared to the other projects in the workspace.
  If it does not then right-click the replicator.vpj project and select
  "Set Active Project".

## Building the Code in Workbench

- Right-click on the library.vpj project and select "Set Active Project"
- From the main menu, select "Build > Load Data Files" to create the ISAM
  data files.
- From the main menu, select "Build > Import Schema to Repository" to load
  the repository schema into repository ISAM files.
- From the main menu, select "Build > Build" to build the library project
- Right-click on the replicator.vpj project and select "Set Active Project"
- From the main menu select "Build > Build" to build the replicator program.
- Right-click on the application.vpj project and select "Set Active Project"
- From the main menu select "Build > Build" to build the main application
- Right-click on the application.vpj project and select "Compile Scripts Setup..."
- Change the "Window Library" file spec so that the path to the EXE\tkapp.ism
  file is correct for your system, then click the OK button.
- Right-click on the application.vpj project and select "Compile Scripts" to
  compile the UI Toolkit window library (creates EXE\tkapp.ism)

## Preparing the Database

The code in this example is configured for use with a local default instance of
a recent version of Microsoft SQL Server (Express edition is OK) that is
configured to accept Windows authentication. The only database preparation
that is necessary is to create an empty database named "SqlReplication".

If your SQL Server database is not local, or does not accept Windows
authentication, you will need to alter the value of the DB_CONSTR identifier
in the source file DatabaseTableTest.dbl. Refer to the section on configuring
connect strings in the Synergy/DE SQL Connection API manual for more details.

## Running the demo

In order to see the replication happenning use SQL Server Management Studio to
connect to the SqlReplication database and display the list of tables in the
database - there aren't any at the moment.  Run the Synergy client application
by ensuring that application.vpj is the current project, and then selecting
"Build > Execute" from the Workbench menu.

Start the replicator process by selecting select "Replicator -> Start Replicator"
from the application menu. You should see some messages, including:

        Initializing SQL Connection
        Connecting to database
        Ready to process instructions...

And you should see the replicator start checking for things to do every 5 seconds

Next pick "Applications -> Employee Maintenance", then cick on the search button
to show a list of all of the employees in the ISAM file.  Double click an
employee to edit it, then change something and click OK.

This will record an update operation in the replication servers transaction log.
Within five seconds it should pick up the entry, realize there is an update to
the database, and try to replicate the change.  The first time this happens
it will realize that the EMPLOYEE table doesn't exist in the database as yet,
so it should create the table, and then initiate a full load of the table from
the ISAM file.

Check Management studio, is the table and data there yet?  If not then you
probably got error messages from the replicator and need to debug the environment.

From now on, as you create, amend and delete employee records, those changes
should be replicated to the EMPLOYEE table in SQL server.  The example
replicator goes to sleep for five seconds if there is nothing to do, so you
should see any changes within that time frame.  If you are sitting looking at
the table in Management studio however, the table is not automatically
refreshed, you you'll have to refresh it manually each time you want to see
a change.

The replicator process would generally be run as a Windows service or detached
process, and can be controlled by putting "instructions" into it's ISAM file.
There are various options on the "Replicator" menu to do this.

For example, to stop the replicator, select "Replicator -> Stop Replicator".

Enjoy!
